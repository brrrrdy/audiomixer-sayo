# audiomixer-sayo

worked out a solution in case anyone is thinking of doing the same (maybe I was just being stupid):

set your macros and layers within the sayodevice software - aka f13 (knob press) to change layer, f14 and f15 for volume up and volume down etc, and then just use those macros with something like Macrodeck. Would probably work with touchportal and streamdeck software too. I don't mind having software running.

I guess it could also be done with Autohotkey, but I'm lazy.

having the screen relay infomation about the app of the respective layer (e.g. current volume, discord server member in channel etc) would be cool. maybe there's a solution for that too.
